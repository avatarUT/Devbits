    <h2>
        What are stocks?
    </h2>
    <p>Stocks are a type of security that gives stockholders a share of ownership in a company. Stocks also are called “equities.”</p>

    <h2>
        Why do people buy stocks?
    </h2>
    <p>Investors buy stocks for various reasons. Here are some of them:
        <ul>
            <li>Capital appreciation, which occurs when a stock rises in price</li>
            <li>Dividend payments, which come when the company distributes some of its earnings to stockholders</li>
            <li>Ability to vote shares and influence the company</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
        Why do companies issue stock?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Companies issue stock to get money for various things, which may include:
        <ul>
            <li>Paying off debt</li>
            <li>Launching new products</li>
            <li>Expanding into new markets or regions</li>
            <li>Enlarging facilities or building new ones</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
        What are the benefits and risks of stocks?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Stocks offer investors the greatest potential for growth (capital appreciation) over the long haul. Investors willing to stick with stocks over long periods of time, say 15 years, generally have been rewarded with strong, positive returns.<br><br>
        But stock prices move down as well as up. There’s no guarantee that the company whose stock you hold will grow and do well, so you can lose money you invest in stocks.<br><br>
        If a company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated, common stockholders are the last in line to share in the proceeds. The company’s bondholders will be paid first, then holders of preferred stock. If you are a common stockholder, you get whatever is left, which may be nothing.<br><br>
        Even when companies aren’t in danger of failing, their stock price may fluctuate up or down. Large company stocks as a group, for example, have lost money on average about one out of every three years. If you have to sell shares on a day when the stock price is below the price you paid for the shares, you will lose money on the sale.<br><br>
        Market fluctuations can be unnerving to some investors. A stock’s price can be affected by factors inside the company, such as a faulty product, or by events the company has no control over, such as political or market events.<br><br>
        Stocks usually are one part of an investor’s holdings. If you are young and saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, you may want to hold more stocks than bonds. Investors nearing or in retirement may want to hold more bonds than stocks.<br><br>
        The risks of stock holdings can be offset in part by investing in a number of different stocks. Investing in other kinds of assets that are not stocks, such as bonds, is another way to offset some of the risks of owning stocks.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Understanding fees
    </h2>
    <p>
        Buying and selling stocks entails fees. A direct stock plan or a dividend reinvestment plan may charge you a fee for that service. Brokers who buy and sell stocks for you charge a commission. A discount brokerage charges lower commissions than what you would pay at a full-service brokerage. But generally you have to research and choose investments by yourself. A full-service brokerage costs more, but the higher commissions pay for investment advice based on that firm’s research.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Avoiding fraud
    </h2>
    <p>
        Stocks in public companies are registered with the SEC and in most cases, public companies are required to file reports to the SEC quarterly and annually. Annual reports include financial statements that have been audited by an independent audit firm. Information on public companies can be found on the SEC’s EDGAR system.
